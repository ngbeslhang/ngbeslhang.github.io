Since FreeCodeCamp wants me to build my own portfolio I decided to redesign it to make it actually looks better. The old design is located at /old folder.

## Pre-redesign README.md
```md
# ngbeslhang.github.io / ngb.li
Just my personal site's source code, which is supposedly YAML/Markdown-esque. The entire site includes the index HTML file and a CSS file (obviously) which also contains part of Roboto Mono CSS `@font-face` directly from Google Fonts' generated code. The entire site is licensed under MIT License so feel free to use it as template etc.

## Inspirations/Credits
- (Most of the) Color scheme: https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/
- Website style: http://yaml.org

## Ideas
- A sidebar for other pages and/or sites.
